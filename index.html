        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="content ">
          <p>
            Stanley Martin Lieber, popularly known as Stan Lee, was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher,
            media producer, television host, actor, and voice actor. He started out his career working as an office boy
            for the Marvel Comics––which meant fetching
            lunch, proof reading and refilling artist's ink jars, eventually proving his creative talent, escalated from
            the position of interim editor to the president of the entire company. He is known for creating superheroes
            like ‘Spider-Man’,
            ‘The Hulk’, ‘X-men’, ‘Iron Man’, ‘Thor’, ‘Doctor Strange’, etc. and gained nationwide popularity when he
            created the superhero series ‘The Fantastic Four’ in which he made his superheroes imperfect rather than
            selling the idea
            of a perfectly capable superhero. He created these superheroes in collaboration with his colleagues, Jack
            Kirby and Steve Ditko. He is said to have brought in revolution in the comic world through his satirical
            writing and bringing
            in the elements of the real world into the world of these superheroes, which is how he used to make these
            superheroes viable and responsible. It was Lee who made Marvel Comics a multimedia corporation from just a
            small division
            of a publishing house. Apart from creating superheroes and writing story plots for the comics, he also wrote
            weekly columns and produced many superhero based ventures through his production company.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Stan Lee was born on December 28, 1922 in New York to Celia and Jack Lieber. His father was a dress cutter
            who did not get much work after the Great Depression. His family had to live in financial difficulties in a
            one-bedroom apartment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Lee attended the DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx and side by side worked small jobs like, writing
            obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center, working as an office
            boy, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            As a child his life was influenced by reading and watching movies. He dreamt of one day writing ‘The Great
            American Novel’. He was hired as an office assistant at Timely Comics and soon became an interim editor.

      <section id="career" class="tabcontent left">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Lee’s entry into the Timely Comics in 1939 proved to be a big step in his career. He started out by doing
            menial jobs but soon made his comic-book debut with the text filler ‘Captain America Foils the Traitor's
            Revenge’.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In 1941, Lee started getting opportunities to do actual comics with a backup feature. He created the
            ‘Destroyer in Mystic Comics No. 6’, ‘Jack Frost in USA Comic No. 1’ and ‘Father Time in Captain America
            Comics No.6’.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>When he was only 19 years old, owing to a conflict in the company and his escalating creativity, Lee was
            made interim editor of the company and worked with the company for a good 31 years, mostly as
            editor-in-chief.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In 1942, he joined the United States Army and served stateside in the Signal Corps. He continued his
            creative streak there by writing manuals, training films and slogans, which is why he was classified in the
            military as ‘playwright’
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            After finishing his stint with the army, Lee joined back the company in 1950s, which was now known as the
            ‘Atlas Comics’. He started experimenting with various genres––writing romantic, sci-fi, horror, humorous
            stories, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Around the same time, he produced a newspaper strip with his colleague Dan DeCarlo, titled ‘My Friend Irma’,
            which was essentially based on a radio comedy that starred Marie Wilson. Lee was getting increasingly
            discontented with his career.
        </div>
        </p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In the late 1950, in competition with DC Comics, Lee’s publisher, Goodman, asked him to create a new
            superhero team. Lee thought to work on the stories that he believed in since he was getting disgruntled with
            his monotonous career.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            For this assignment, Lee, in association with his colleague Jack Kirby, created a team of superheroes called
            ‘Fantastic Four’ with superheroes like, ‘Hulk’, ‘Iron Man’, ‘Thor’, ‘Spider-Man, ‘X-Men’, ‘Doctor Strange’,
            etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Throughout 1960s, he scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series while moderating the letters
            pages. He was also writing a monthly column, ‘Stan’s Soapbox’. His job was getting very taxing but Lee, for
            once, was enjoying it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In 1971, Lee was asked to write a story on bad-effects of drugs and he thought of including it in ‘The
            Amazing Spider-Man’. The Comics Code Authority was against it because the portrayal of drugs was against the
            code.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Lee and Goodman went ahead with it anyway and published the story in their comics. The story got really
            famous and Marvel was appreciated for spreading the responsible message. The CCA abolished the Code and
            permitted negative depictions of drugs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            From 1975, he was more busy and gained popularity as a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He
            attended the comic book conventions around America, lectured at colleges and participated in panel
            discussions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Lee’s role in the company was becoming bigger and bigger as in 1981 he was given the role to develop
            Marvel’s TV and movie properties, for which he had to shift to California with his family.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            He was made the president of the company but Lee found the task to be a little more technical than he could
            handle. So to remain closer to the creative processes of the company he stepped down to become the
            publisher.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            In 1998, Lee along with Peter Paul started a new Internet-based superhero creation, production and marketing
            studio, ‘Stan Lee Media’. The company grew and gained a considerable success but had to be closed down due
            to legal implications.

          <p>
            When Lee finished his 65 years with Marvel, it honored him in 2006 with the publication of a series of
            one-shot comics in which Lee was shown interacting with his co-creations like ‘Spider-Man’, ‘Doctor
            Strange’, etc.

            In 2007, at the Comic-Con International, a Stan Lee action figure was launched in order to honor him. The
